# Docker services

This repository contains a simple test of some docker services. What I tried to do is using an image from mongodb and expose the port to my local machine, where I can connect me through a nodejs-express app. Also put all this code into a container that the final user can build whenever he wants.

## Tools used:
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongodb
